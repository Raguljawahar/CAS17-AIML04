INNOVATION AND UNIQUENESS:

Innovation & Uniqueness

Context-Aware NLP: Utilizes transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) to understand the context behind words, reducing false positives.

Real-Time Analysis: Enables instant detection of harmful content, providing real-time intervention.

Sentiment & Emotion Detection: Goes beyond simple toxicity detection by identifying underlying emotions like anger, sadness, or harassment intent.

Multilingual Support: Detects cyberbullying in multiple languages, making it globally adaptable.

Explainable AI: Provides insights into why a comment is flagged, increasing transparency and trust.

Adaptive Learning: Continuously improves by learning from new patterns of online harassment.
